+	zimbu: A no-nonsense programming language
		> Project hosted at: http://code.google.com/p/zimbu/
		> Homepage: http://www.zimbu.org/
		> Why Zimbu?
		>
		> Suppose you want to write a new program, something like a text
		> editor. What language would you write it in?
		> 	-	It has to be as fast as possible, so interpreted
		> 		languages are out.
		> 	-	You don't want to micro manage memory, so C is out.
		> 	-	You don't want to require programmers to have a
		> 		degree, so C++ is out.
		> 	-	You want fast startup and not depend on a big runtime,
		> 		so Java is out.
		> 	-	It has to run on most systems, anything with a C
		> 		compiler, so D is out.
		> 	-	You want to have fun making something new.
		> No existing language really meets these demands, so let's
		> create a new one that does!
		>
		> Zimbu is an experimental programming language.  It is a very
		> practical, no-nonsense kind of language.  It mixes the good
		> things of many existing languages and avoids their
		> deficiencies.  And then throws in a few brand new ideas.
