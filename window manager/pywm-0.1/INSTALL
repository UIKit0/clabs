INSTALL file for PYWM - Python Window Manager
http://pywm.sourceforge.net
------------------------------------------------------
*** RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS

To run PYWM, you will need:

 * Python 2.2.1 or later
 * FLTK graphical toolkit - STRICTLY VERSION 1.0
   library and headers. If your distro does not have
   it, you can get it from http://fltk.sourceforge.net
 * xlibmesa3
 * libgl1
 * xlibs
 * libstdc++ - libs plus headers
 
------------------------------------------------------
*** INSTALLING BINARY PACKAGE

 * If you feel impatient, or you just hate building
   stuff from source, you could try the binary module
   included in this package.

 * The binary package is quite likely to work if your system
   has glibc version 2.2 or later, as well as Python 2.2.1 or
   later.
 
 * Note that this binary package is statically linked against
   FLTK version 1.0, so you need not bother downloading and
   installing FLTK version 1.0
    
 * To install the binary:
 
    (i)   Create a directory called 'flwm' and put it
          in your Python load path (quite often, this
          is /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages).
    
    (ii)  Uncompress the file 'flwm_.so.bz2' with bunzip2
          then copy it into the 'flwm' directory
    
    (iii) Copy all the files in src-python into the
          'flwm' directory.

------------------------------------------------------
*** BUILDING FROM SOURCE

This section describes how to compile PYWM completely
from source and install it to your system.

------------------------------------------------------
**** COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS

Building from source will require the following:

  * python 2.2.1 or later
  * FLTK graphical toolkit - VERSION 1.0!
    at least the linkable libraries and header files.
    FLTK is available from http://fltk.sourceforge.net
    Make sure you have FLTK version 1.0 installed before
    trying to build PYWM.
  * Pyrex - Python<->C interface generator. Best thing
    since Python itself. Get yours from:
    http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
  * Development versions of the following libraries:
    libstdc++, xlibmesa3, libgl1, xlibs

------------------------------------------------------
*** COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you have successfully [built and] installed FLTK, you
can log in as root and type:
    
    make install

If the make completes successfully, you will have:
 
  * The PYWM launcher utility, installed as
    /usr/bin/pywm-run.py
    This program pops up a window of available window
    manager scripts, as well as an xterm fallback
    
  * The directory 'pywm' installed in your Python
    site-packages directory. Note that within this pywm
    directory is a copy of the examples directory.

------------------------------------------------------
*** HOW DO I RUN A WINDOW MANAGER?

Perhaps the most comfortable way to do this is to put
into your ~/.xinitrc file the command:

    pywm-run.py

When you restart your X server, you should see a menu on
the screen listing 2 options - 'example1' and 'X-Term'.

To add your own window manager scripts to this menu,
simply place or symlink these scripts into ~/.pywm.

Note that if you are adding a Python file, you will
need to copy or symlink it in with a .py or .pyc
extension. Anything with a different extension will be
ignored, while anything without an extension will be
launched with a shell instead of with python.
    
Look in the examples/ directory for some working
examples, which should give you some ideas for building
your own heavenly window managers.

Refer to the README file, plus the API reference manual
(in the html/ directory) for more information.

*** ALTERNATELY

You could simply put into your ~/.xinit file the command
  python /path/to/my/pywm/examples/example1.py
(replace example1.py with whatever script you are using).
