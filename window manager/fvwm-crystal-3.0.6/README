FVWM-Crystal
http://fvwm-crystal.berlios.de/
-------------------------------

FVWM-Crystal aims to create an easy to use, powerful desktop environment for
Linux or other Unix-like operating systems with lots of eye-candy.

It uses following programs: FVWM as a window manager and "main core", ROX-Filer
or Nautilus as desktop manager (manages icons on the desktop), gnome-terminal,
xterm, aterm, mrxvt or urxvt as terminal emulators, MPD, QuodLibet or XMMS as
music players (there's built-in support for controlling these programs), and
several other tools for different functions, like setting a wallpaper or making
screenshots.


Key features
------------

- Transparent elements of the interface: panels, menus, dialogs
  (pseudo-transparency, doesn't show windows underneath).

- Window decorations, panel/menu color-sets and desktop wallpaper changeable
  from the main menu; choice saved for next X sessions.

- Flexible window decorations: can have different title-bar buttons layout,
  pixmaps and button functions.

- Different "recipes" (panel placement and functions, desktop
  functions, window icons/thumbnails), changeable from the menu.

- Advanced keyboard support: key-bindings for controlling the desktop
  switching, window management (moving, resizing, focusing, basic operations
  like minimization or closing) - in total there are nearly 90 different
  key-bindings.

- Support for controlling music players by using the keyboard or panel buttons
  and menus; currently AlsaPlayer, audacious. cdcd, cmus, mocp, mpd, mplayer (you
  can also play movies with it), Quodlibet, XMMS and XMMS2 are supported.

- Advanced support of the terminal windows: special "Quake Console" terminal
  accessible by an Alt+` (grave) keystroke similar to the console found in FPP
  games; terminals can be opened using RMB on the desktop; terminal windows
  don't release focus for newly opened windows (by default).

- A Python script for generating different panels and menus with installed
  applications - automatically finds programs in $PATH and creates specified
  menus and panels.

- Support for nearly 400 different applications - icons, menu/panel database
  entries and window styles.

- Localization support using gettext.


Advanced features
-----------------

- All FVWM configuration is divided into small files in a simple directory
  structure.

- Special functions for loading configuration files â€“ allows for FVWM
  configuration files placed in different directories (for example system-wide
  and user-wide); user files are searched before system-wide files (directory
  structure must be preserved), the first found file is loaded.

- Simple and easy to use system of "user preferences" which adds to the
  configuration files' ability to remember different user choices and recall
  them at any moment, usually at the startup of X session.

- Support for system-wide configuration in /etc/X11/fvwm/fvwm-crystal directory
  as well as user configuration in ~/.fvwm directory - changes in configuration
  files can be preserved between package updates.

- Special files called "recipes" - similar to "standard" FVWM configuration
  model (one configuration - one file), allows for different configurations in
  the same package (for example different music players changeable during
  runtime).

- Support for different icon themes and sizes (similar to /usr/share/icons
  directory), included are many icons in 22x22, 32x32 and 48x48 sizes.

- Special script that will generate the application menu entries by searching for
  application type desktop files and applications icons.
