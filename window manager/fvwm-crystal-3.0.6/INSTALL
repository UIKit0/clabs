FVWM-Crystal installation instructions
======================================

Installing from a package
-------------------------
Uncompress the package to a temporary directory and issue command:

	make install

FVWM-Crystal will be installed in /usr/local directory, so you need to become
root for installation to work. If you want to install Crystal in other
directory, or you don't have access to a root account, you can change the
prefix:

	make prefix=/usr install


Installing from svn repository
------------------------------
cd to the repository and issue commands:

	make install

Optionally copy 'addons/fvwm-crystal.desktop' to /usr/share/xsessions/, then
you will be able to select "FVWM-Crystal" in your GDM/KDM login manager.


Note on fvwm-crystal.generate-menu
----------------------------------
fvwm-crystal.generate-menu is a script that can be used to generate the missing
FVWM-Crystal applications menu entries. To be able to do that, it must know
where FVWM-Crystal is installed and where are the applications type *.desktop
files. This is handled by a few variables in the script and it can be needed
to edit some of them before to run the script.

The FVWM-Crystal related variables will be modified to the correct location
by "make install". But it is no way the Makefile can know for sure where the 
application type desktop files are installed in your distribution.

Variables to check in fvwm-crystal.generate-menu:
-------------------------------------------------
DesktopDir="Path_to_the_desktop_files" usualy 
"/usr/share/applications /usr/local/share /path/to/kde/share/application /path/to/gnome/apps"

SYSTEM_ICONDIRS="Path_to_the_icon_files" usualy
"/usr/share/pixmaps /usr/share/icons /path/to/kde/share/icons"

Note to distribution maintainer:
--------------------------------
If you package management system is using a sandbox when building the package,
you must also pay attention to the following variables: 

FC_MENUBASEROOT="path_to_FVWM-Crystal_application_menu", usualy
"/usr/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm/Applications".

FC_ICONBASEROOT="path_to_FVWM-Crystal_icons", usualy
"/usr/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm/icons/Default".


General installation tips
-------------------------
If you don't have your own ~/.Xresources, copy one from 'addons/' directory.
You can also find there sample ~/.Xsession (or ~/.xinitrc) file.

You need recent version of Python installed for 'fvwm-crystal.apps' script.
And of course unstable version of FVWM (2.5.13+ or CVS) would be good... ;)
