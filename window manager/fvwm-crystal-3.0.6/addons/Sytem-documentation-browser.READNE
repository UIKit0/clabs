System Documentation Browser for FVWM-Crystal

Author: Dominique Michel <dominique.libre@sourceforge.net>

You can browse your system documentation in /usr/share/doc directly from
FVWM-Crystal menu:

Menu -> FVWM-Crystal -> FVWM-Crystal -> Main system documentation.

This function use the $PAGER variable to determine the pager program.
If this variable is not set, it will use less.

Depending to your distribution, less can or not be able to display the
files in /usr/share/doc/*. If it doesn't work as expected with less,
please do the following:

1) copy fvwm-crystal.lesspipe.sh somewhere in your path. /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin are good locations.

2) export the LESSOPEN variable. With bash as login shell, do:

   export LESSOPEN="|fvwm-crystal.lesspipe.sh %s"

You can made it permanent by adding the line above in ~/.bashrc

3) enjoy.
