FVWM 2.6.1
==========

Latest stable release fixes the following:

This is a bug-fix release only, there are no new features.

* Minor glitches in fvwm-menu-desktop, specifically:
    * Perl version check to use 5.008;
    * Checking for XML::Parser a runtime option, as this module is a
      non-standard perl module which isn't guaranteed to be on all systems
      when it's run.

* Force the version of Fribidi to be >= 0.19.2
