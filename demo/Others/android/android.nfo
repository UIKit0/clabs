"android" pc-64k intro by fresh!mindworkz, released at marast'05, czech republic

Technical Info:

  Known bugs:

  - Win95/98/ME not supported, so maybe it works, maybe not.
  - This intro is a fast "afterwork" production, don't expect to much
  - Sorry for the long precalc time, we had no time to speedoptimize

  Windows:

  Needs an OpenGL 1.2 compatible videocard (with 64mb of ram) and a standard 
  dsound soundcard. Should run without hardware t&l also... 
  Windows bugreports: pasy@freshmindworkz.hu

  Linux:

  The linux version is bigger than 64k, because it must emulate the
  fontsystem of windows, and we must static link a library to be compatible
  with debain

  More info later, in final version...

  Linux bugreports: pontscho@makacs.poliod.hu

  GeForce or Ati Radeon cards).
