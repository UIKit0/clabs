# gtkuid - GTK+2 User-Interface Daemon
Designed for shell scripts.

## Introduction
When shell programming, there are some circumstances where we need to
create a GUI. Some simple work can be done with dialog/zenity, but when
it comes to complex GUIs, nothing can be used before.

So, gtkuid is designed to fill the blank. With gtkuid, you can create
complex GUIs in shell.
